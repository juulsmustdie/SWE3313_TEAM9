# Technology Description

## Programming Language

Our team decided on **Python** for our choice of programming language. 

Every team member had a different programming language they preferred, but everyone said they either had some experience with Python before or were interested in using it. The syntax for Python is also less intricate than our other options, so this was another thing to consider when making our decision.

Python was ultimately the best middle ground option for our group.

## Framework

Our team will be using **Flask** as our web framework to create the screens for our system.

Flask was the only option under Python (Refer to the [project github under the technology selection in project plan](https://github.com/jeff-adkisson/swe-3313-spring-2025/blob/main/project/README.md#technology-selection)).

## Storage plan 

Our team has selected **JSON** for our storage mechanism.

JSON uses JavaScript, which uses Java and C for its syntax. Since everyone is proficient in either language or at least familiar with them, we thought it would be best to choose JSON.


## Operating environment

Our operating environment will be on **Windows**.

## Other Necessary Software

Nothing else is needed at the moment! This may change in the future as we work through this project.
