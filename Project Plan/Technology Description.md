# Technology Description

## Programming Language

Our team decided on **Python** for our choice of programming language. 

Every team member had a different programming language they preferred, but everyone said they either had some experience with Python before or were interested in using it. The syntax for Python is also less intricate than our other options, so this was another thing to consider when making our decision.

Python was ultimately the best middle ground option for our group.

## Framework

Our team will be using **Flask** as our web framework to create the screens for our system.

Flask was the only option under Python (Refer to the [project github under the technology selection in project plan](https://github.com/jeff-adkisson/swe-3313-spring-2025/blob/main/project/README.md#technology-selection)).
