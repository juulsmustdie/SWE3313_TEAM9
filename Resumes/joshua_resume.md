# Joshua Reimbeau

**About me:**

My name is Joshua Reimbeau, and I am a Game Development major currently completing my sophomore year Kennesaw State University. I’ve always been interested in video games, and am actively honing my skills to eventually make my magnum opus with a team of talented and passionate programmers. I’m looking for opportunities to escape the classroom and enhance my skills through real-world experiences. With the knowledge C#, Python, and GDScrpit I’ve gained through my school projects and personal projects, I’m sure I can be a hefty asset to your team. Hope we can make some amazing programs together.
