# Introduction

Welcome to the Technical Design section of our project repository!

As we approach the final part of our semester-long project, our technical design serves as a structured plan on how our team will implement our application and achieve a high-quality product. 

Below are links to quick, in-depth summaries about our chosen programming language/framework, data storage plan, and the coding style we will abide by while implementing our final application.

We have also created helpful diagrams and tables that display the entities and relationships in our system along with examples.

As always, we have a link to a video presentation on this section for your time and convenience. 

If you have any questions/concerns, feel free to contact us at any time.
