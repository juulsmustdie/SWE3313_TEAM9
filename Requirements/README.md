# Introduction

Welcome to the requirements section of our SWE3313 Project! 

Here, you will find everything regarding what our application needs to have/do based on our customer's wishes and how these features will be executed.

Below are links to said customer notes, finalized requirements for Version 1, a Use Case Diagram illustrating how the users interact with the application, and a decision table showing what each role can and cannot do. 

To save you some time, we also linked our 5 minute Loom video presentation of this section at the very bottom.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us via email.
