# Introduction

Welcome to the requirements section of our SWE3313 Project! 

Here, you will find everything regarding what our application needs to have/do based on our customer's wishes and how these features will be executed.

Below are links to said customer notes, finalized requirements for Version 1, a Use Case Diagram illustrating how the users interact with the application, and a decision table showing what each role can and cannot do. 

To save you some time, we also linked our Loom video presentation of this section at the very bottom.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us via email.
