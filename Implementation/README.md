# Introduction (WIP)

Welcome to the implementation section of our team repository! 

After much planning and preparation, we have finally implemented the Bakes n' Shakes web application.

**With this application, customers will now be able to:**

- View the Bakes n' Shakes menu options (including each item's photo, price, and description)
  
- Add any item to their cart
  
- Modify their selections at checkout
  
- View their total before and after modifications
  
- Place their orders for pick-up

Every customer will also receive an order confirmation after payment along with a copy of their receipt.

# Environment requirements

Our application can run on the following operating systems:
- Windows
- MacOS
