# Introduction (WIP)

Welcome to the implementation section of our team repository! 

After much planning and preparation, we have finally implemented the Bakes n' Shakes web application.

### User Interface for Customers

*With this application, customers will now be able to:*

- View the Bakes n' Shakes menu options (including each item's photo, price, and description)

- Search for a specific item in the search bar
  
- Add any item to their cart
  
- Modify their selections at checkout
  
- View their total before and after modifications
  
- Place their orders for pick-up

Every customer will also receive an order confirmation after payment along with a copy of their receipt.

### User Interface for Admins

*With this application, admin users will now be able to:*

- Login/create an account
  
- Promote other users as admin

- Add new items to the menu (includes adding the photo, price, and description)
  
- Modify any existing items on the menu

- Generate sales reports

- Pull up the receipts for purchased items

##
### Additional Features

*Other helpful features of this application include:*

- Click feature on the Bakes n' Shakes name in the upper left that returns the user to the homepage

- 'Login' button for admins to login from any page

# Final Project Presentation

As always, we have a video presentation of the application for your convenience. 

This video includes a run through of the cafe application (both as a customer and admin), a comparison between the Marvel UI design and our final product, and any additional comments/points about the application.

We are excited for you to see and finally use our product! We hope that everything exceeded your expectations and we thank you for the opportunity to work together on this project.
