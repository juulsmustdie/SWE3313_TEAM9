# Environment requirements

Our application can run on the following operating systems:
- Windows
- MacOS

## Application Setup Guide

#### Windows (Step-by-step):

1. Download all necessary files [here]().
   
2. Save files into one folder.
    - *Note: I would recommend storing this folder under a short, descriptive name and placing it in a easy-to-find spot in your directory.*
    
3. Open up your Command Prompt
   
4. From there, copy the pathway to your folder or type it in manually (such as '_C:\Users\abc>cd Documents>cd Folder_')

5. To install Flask, type in the following command:

   _py -m venv env_

6. Afterwards, your folder pathway should reprint on your terminal. Type in the following command activate your virtual environment:

   _env\Scripts\activate_

7. Once you see the '_(env)_' next to your folder pathway, you can now install flask by typing in the following command:

    _pip install flask_

8. Once Flask is installed, we can now run the application by typing:

    _set [FOLDER_NAME]=run.py_
   
   - *Note: [FOLDER_NAME] should be whatever you decided to name the folder that stores all the app files. Aside from that, type everything else exactly how you see it.*
     
9. After that, simply type in the '_flask run_' command to run the application.
    
10. If done correctly, you should see a URL link. Copy and paste that into your browser and you can now access our website.

### MacOS (Step-by-step)

1. Download all necessary files [here]().

2. Save files into one folder.
    - *Note: I would recommend storing this folder under a short, descriptive name and placing it in a easy-to-find spot in your directory.*

3. Open up your Terminal Application.

4. From there, copy the pathway to your folder or type it in manually (such as '_johndoe123@abc-MacBook-Pro Desktop % cd [FOLDER_NAME]_')

5. To install Flask, type in the following command:

   _python3 -m venv venv_

6. Afterwards, your folder pathway should reprint on your terminal. Type in the following command activate your virtual environment:

   _source venv/bin/activate_

7. Once you see the '_(venv)_' next to your folder pathway, you can now install flask by typing in the following command:

   _pip install flask_

8. Once Flask is installed, we can now run the application by typing:

    _python3 run.py_
    
10. If done correctly, you should see a URL link. Copy and paste that into your web browser and you can now access our website.

# Final Project Presentation

As always, we have a video presentation of the application for your convenience. 

This video includes a run through of the cafe application (both as a customer and admin), a comparison between the Marvel UI design and our final product, and any additional comments/points about the application.

We are excited for you to see and finally use our product! We hope that everything exceeded your expectations and we thank you for the opportunity to work together on this project.
